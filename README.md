# Digit recognition (tkinter version)

It is my first program made using tkinter. I used model which recognizes digits on photos made by Yassine Ghouzam (https://www.kaggle.com/yassineghouzam/introduction-to-cnn-keras-0-997-top-6).

App is really simple. The only thing in the window of program is button. When clicked you can choose a file from hard drive and upload it to program. Then your photo is shown on the screen and t=next to it label, with digit recognized, is shown. It is the best to upload a photo which resolution is close to square. Preferably the photo should be bright and there should be good contrast between digit and background.

Building model and making function which takes photo from drive and recognizes digit on it I placed in another repository: https://github.com/msarnacki/digit-recognition-kaggle
